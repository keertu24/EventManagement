            <p>"A huge thank you to the team at upevent  Management for making my 40th Birthday so special. I chose upevent catering and staff because from the first contact I felt confident in your commitment to make my event exceptional and a willingness to go the extra mile to help with all the planning and details. My guests have all told me that every single canapé was delicious and the chef, catering and beverage staff were so professional, friendly and helpful. You knocked our socks off. Thanks so much. We will definitely use upevent again in the future."</p><br>

Amy and her staff were efficient, professional and a breath of fresh air to work along side. Amy went above and beyond to create an amazing event that hit the brief given. It was an absolute pleasure working with her and I would highly recommended Amy for any event planning.
